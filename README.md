# Netpro

This tool allows you to quickly change your network adapter IP address on your Windows PC.

Built on Powershell. UI is made using Xaml.

***For Microsoft Windows only!!***

## Features

- Adapter selection
- Choose between static & DCHP
- Add additional static IP addresses to an adapter

This tool will only select adapters that are connected and physical. It will not include Wi-Fi.
## Installation

To install, download the latest install.bat from https://github.com/DarthKillian/eti-tools/releases/latest/download/install.bat

Run the install.bat in your Downloads folder. This will likely trigger Microsoft's anti-virus and ask you to confirm before running.

The install.bat will download the latest script files from github and extract the files to C:\ProgramData\netpro. After the download and extraction is complete, it will copy the netpro.bat file to your desktop. This is how you launch netpro when you need to use it.

After the script has ran, it will automatically launch netpro for you.

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress. I aim to build useful tools but, that takes time. If this project proves useful, I may expand on it in the future.
